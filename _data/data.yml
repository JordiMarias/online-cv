        The Master's degree in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies (MATT) offers a broad selection of optional credits that are organised by concentration but also provide enough flexibility for students to create their own profile. On this master’s degree, you can choose one of the concentrations proposed by the schools or build your own specific profile by selecting the optional subjects you are interested in at each school. The track I followed is the track in Deep learning for multimedia processing (ETSETB).
